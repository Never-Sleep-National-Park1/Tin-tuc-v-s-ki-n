          <p>We manage more than 890 protected areas in NSW, covering over 7.5 million hectares of land.
            This represents more than 9.5 per cent of the land area in the state.
            This includes national parks, nature reserves, flora reserves, World Heritage areas, rainforests, beaches, alpine areas and sites of great cultural and historic significance. Management of these areas involves a wide range of responsibilities, including plant and animal conservation, fire management, sustainable tourism and visitation, research, education, volunteering programs and more.</p>
